# Exploratory Data Analysis of Russian Propaganda Telegram Channels

## Overview

This project conducts exploratory data analysis on a dataset comprising 299 Telegram channels, totaling over 8 million posts. The primary focus is on Russian Propaganda Telegram channels, aiming to gain insights into the mindset of their audience, analyze the language used, and deconstruct propaganda methodologies using statistical methods.

The dataset was collected by Kate Burovova (kate.burovova@gmail.com), and due to data sensitivity, it cannot be shared directly within this repository. However, you are encouraged to reach out to the author to obtain the dataset if you need to use it. In the provided Jupyter notebook, I work with a merged dataframe, combining messages from each channel present in the dataset.

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis Notebook:** The core of the project is in the Jupyter notebook (`RPTG_eda.ipynb`). This notebook contains the Python code for exploratory data analysis.

- **Graphs:** The `graphs` folder includes a variety of visualized graphs presenting statistics and information derived from the dataset. These visualizations aim to provide a clear and insightful representation of the data analysis.

## Dependencies

Before running or altering the notebook on your machine, make sure to install the necessary dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk stop-words tqdm textblob scikit-learn
```

## Getting started
To replicate the analysis or modify the notebook for your needs, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
  ```
2. Install Dependencies.

3. Contact the Author for the Dataset:
Reach out to Kate Burovova (kate.burovova@gmail.com) to obtain the dataset. Remember that the notebook works with a merged dataframe containing messages from each channel present in the dataset.

4. Run the Notebook:
Open and run the Jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb to explore, analyze, and visualize the data. Feel free to customize and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements.
